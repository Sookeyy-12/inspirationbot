![Problem Statement](./utilities/intro.png)

***inspirationbot* is a website that links to random art references by topic. You can use it to improve your skill at painting, drawing or sketching.**

It is available at <https://inspirationbot.art/> - go check it out (free, no signup, no ads). It looks like this:

*inspirationbot* is also a sandbox for creative web design. As such, there exist several visually different versions of the site - currently there are three, with many more to come. You are also welcome to add your own. Here is a list of all versions that currently exist:

* [Collage](https://inspirationbot.art/versions/collage/main.html)
* [Version 2](https://inspirationbot.art/versions/2/main.html)
* [De Stijl](https://inspirationbot.art/versions/destijl/main.html)
* [Plain HTML](https://inspirationbot.art/versions/plainhtml/main.html)

## About

I started *inspirationbot* as an attempt to build something fun and useful with good ol' plain HTML. It's playful, not entirely serious but nonetheless intends to be useful: Finding good references for art practice is a real problem of mine, and this is my attempt to solve it. I hope you find it as useful!

## Running the Project Locally

*inspirationbot* is currently made entirely from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and plain text files. Most code is very simple, self-contained, uses few libraries and no frameworks.

If you are an apprentice programmer looking to practice or modify the project, you are very welcome! Simply [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and read the next section to see what's what.

## Structure

![Structure Overview](./utilities/structure.png)

The project has essentially two big components: 

1. The part that the user sees
2. Various components in the back that make the site work

Depending on what you are interested in, you don't necessarily need to wrap your head around the whole project. The user-facing part of *inspirationbot* lives exclusively in `index.html` and the `versions/` folder and is written entirely in HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript.

Without ever leaving `versions`, you can:

* change and extend the appearance of the site
* add your own design to the site
* fix typos, improve wording and do other minor edits
* experiment with the user interface
